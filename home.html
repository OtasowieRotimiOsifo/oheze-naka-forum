<h2> Facts </h2>
<p>
  <strong>
  As of 2016, the school had enrolment of 206 pupils and 8 teachers but a recent <br>
  visit to the village speak disaster, only 26 pupils are in the school. The reason <br>
  for this was the calamity that befell the school in 2016 when rainstorm destroyed a <br>
  block of three classes. There were appeals to the government with no response.In 2017,<br>
  window from the almost destroyed classroom fell on two pupils and break their hands <br>
  and feet, hence the withdrawal of pupils from the school to safe ones.
